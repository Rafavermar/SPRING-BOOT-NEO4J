# Neo4j with Java Spring Boot and React Project

This project aims to demonstrate how to use Neo4j in conjunction with Java Spring Boot and React to build a web application. 
The project consists of a REST API connected to a Neo4j database, which contains information about courses, their lessons, and the relationships between users and courses.


## Features
- Integration of Neo4j into a Java Spring Boot and React application.
- Modeling and storage of relationships in a graph database.
- Use of Cypher Query Language for data querying and analysis.
- Implementation of basic functionalities of a web application, such as user and course management.
- Intuitive and attractive user interface developed with React.
-
